<h1>BUS Reservation System</h1>
<br>
This is a Java-based bus reservation system that allows administrators and customers to interact with the system and perform various operations. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing ticket bookings and viewing available and booked tickets.
<br>
<h2>Features:</h2>

<h3>Administrator Role:</h3> The system supports an admin role for managing the system.<br><br>
<h3>Authentication:</h3> The admin can log in using a username and password for secure access<br><br>
<h3>Admin Operations:</h3>  Once logged in, the admin can perform the following operations:
<h3>View available tickets:</h3>  Display a list of available tickets that can be booked.
<h3>View booked tickets:</h3>  Display a list of tickets that have been already booked.
<h3>Book a new ticket:</h3>  Allows the admin to book a ticket for a customer by specifying the ticket number and passenger name.
<h3>Customer Role:</h3>  The system also caters to customer interactions.
<h3>Customer Operations:</h3>  The customer can perform the following operations:
<h3>View available tickets:</h3>  Display a list of available tickets for booking.
<h3>Book a ticket:</h3>  Allows the customer to book a ticket by providing the ticket number and passenger name.
<h3>Ticket Management:</h3>  The system maintains a list of available tickets with their corresponding status (booked or not booked yet). Each ticket is identified by a unique ticket number.
<h3>Error Handling:</h3>  The system handles invalid inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
This project serves as a starting point for developing a bus reservation system and can be expanded further to incorporate additional features such as ticket cancellation, ticket search, and payment integration.
