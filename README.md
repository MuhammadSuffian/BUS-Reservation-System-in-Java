This is a Java-based bus reservation system that allows administrators and customers to interact with the system and perform various operations. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing ticket bookings and viewing available and booked tickets.

Features:

Administrator Role: The system supports an admin role for managing the system.
Authentication: The admin can log in using a username and password for secure access.
Admin Operations: Once logged in, the admin can perform the following operations:
View available tickets: Display a list of available tickets that can be booked.
View booked tickets: Display a list of tickets that have been already booked.
Book a new ticket: Allows the admin to book a ticket for a customer by specifying the ticket number and passenger name.
Customer Role: The system also caters to customer interactions.
Customer Operations: The customer can perform the following operations:
View available tickets: Display a list of available tickets for booking.
Book a ticket: Allows the customer to book a ticket by providing the ticket number and passenger name.
Ticket Management: The system maintains a list of available tickets with their corresponding status (booked or not booked yet). Each ticket is identified by a unique ticket number.
Error Handling: The system handles invalid inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
This project serves as a starting point for developing a bus reservation system and can be expanded further to incorporate additional features such as ticket cancellation, ticket search, and payment integration.
